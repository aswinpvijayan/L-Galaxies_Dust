* Some notes on the dust model implementation

** Compile time flags

DETAILED_DUST - Follows the production/growth and destruction of dust.
FULL_DUST_RATES - Tracks the production/growth/destruction rate (averaged over
the previous snapshot?).

** Data associated with dust

In the present version of the model, dust is present only in the cold ISM: it is
assumed to be destroyed on a short timescale in the hot gas.  
Dust is stored as an elements array that measures how much of each element is
locked up in dust.  It used to be that dust was stored as an amount of different
dust types (C, SiC, Fe, PAH, ...) but grain growth means that these types get
all mixed up.  As the majority of dust arises via grain growth, it was thought
much easier simply to track the mass of each element tied up in dust grains.

Note: Dust is *contained in* elements is *contained in* gas - they are not
separate species.  So the *free* elements not locked up in dust are (elements-dust).

In allvars.h : struct galaxy
#ifdef DETAILED_DUST
#ifdef FULL_DUST_RATES
	struct DustRates DustISMRates;		
#endif
	struct elements DustISM_elements; 
#endif //DETAILED_DUST

In h_metals.h: 
#ifdef FULL_DUST_RATES
#define NDUST 5 // Needed for HDF5 table creation - should match struct below
struct DustRates
{
  float AGB;
  float SNII;
  float SNIA;
  float GROW;
  float DEST;
};
#endif //FULL_DUST_RATES

** Dust growth

Dust growth is based on the implementation in PSG16 but is a bit of a kludge.
There are many approximations in there that don't seem to have the correct
limits and I suspect that it only works if the accretion timescale within clouds
is much less than the exchange timescale of clouds with the diffuse ISM.
