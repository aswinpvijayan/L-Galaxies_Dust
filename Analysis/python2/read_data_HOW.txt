HOWTO read L-Galaxies output...               Last updated 23-Sep-15
...in python

The snapshot data can be read using the routine read_lgal.py to be
found in SAM/python(3)/.  An example of how to do this can be found in
SAM/python(3)/script_read.py.  Unlike the IDL version, this script can
be modified to read in only those galaxy properties that you desire.

Reading the the raw data can take a long time.  It is recommended that
you write a script to select only those galaxies that you want and
then use the 'pickle' function within python to write that data in native
binary format - that will make it much quicker to 'unpickle' the next
time that you want to load it.  Example scripts can be found at
SAM/python(3)/script_(un)pickle.py.

Examples of scripts to make plots with said data can be found in
SAM/python(3)/script_smf.py and the like.
